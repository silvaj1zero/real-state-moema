# Tech Research v3.2 - Deep Technical Research Pipeline

**Version:** 3.2
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-06
**Epic:** TECH-RESEARCH-001
**Skill Path:** `.claude/skills/tech-research/`

---

## Overview

Tech Research is an AIOX skill that transforms technical questions into structured, documented research with actionable findings. It automates the full pipeline: query analysis, multi-source search, coverage evaluation, and synthesis.

### What Changed from v3.1

| Aspect | v3.1 declared | v3.2 current |
|--------|----|----|
| Search execution | Orchestrator-Worker (Haiku subagents) | Main-context Agent default; optional worker only if runtime exposes it |
| Model routing | Haiku for search/read/eval, Main for synthesis | Main runtime with deterministic scripts for scoring, metrics, validation |
| Mechanical artifacts | Optional/recommended in practice | `metrics.yaml` and `pipeline-state.yaml` mandatory |
| Completion gate | Validator advisory | `output_validator.py` blocks completion |
| Version traceability | No explicit marker | `workflow_version` required in SKILL, README metadata, metrics |

### What Changed from v1

| Aspect | v1 | v2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Clarification | 3 fixed questions (always) | Auto-inference, 0-1 questions |
| Search | Sequential, single thread | Parallel dispatch, multi-query |
| Depth Control | None (subjective) | Coverage evaluation loop with thresholds |
| Cost Control | None (unbounded) | Token budgets per phase via config.yaml |
| Configuration | Hardcoded | External config.yaml, fully tunable |

### Key Features

- **Auto-Clarification**: Pattern matching + technology detection infers context automatically
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks query into 3-7 atomic, searchable sub-queries
- **Runtime-Honest Search**: Executes sub-queries in main context unless an actual worker exists
- **Coverage Evaluation Loop**: Iterates search waves until coverage >= 80% or diminishing returns
- **Mechanical Traceability**: Requires metrics, pipeline state, workflow version, citation marker, and validator pass
- **Backward Compatible**: Every v2 feature degrades gracefully if its dependency is missing

```

### Model Routing

| Phase | Model | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 0, 1, 1.5, 2 | Main (Opus/Sonnet) | Planning requires deep reasoning |
| 3, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6 | Main + deterministic scripts | Current runtime evidence shows worker dispatch is not reliable |
| 4, 4.5, 5 | Main (Opus/Sonnet) | Synthesis requires judgment and creativity |

### Cost Expectations

Cost is measured from runtime artifacts, not promised from an aspirational routing plan.
`metrics.yaml` is the source of truth for wave count, tool count, model tier, and validator result.

### ETL Integration

The skill uses the ETL service at `infrastructure/services/etl/` for zero-cost content extraction:

**YouTube Transcripts:**
```bash
node infrastructure/services/etl/bin/youtube-transcript.js {videoId} --format json
```

**Blog/Article Extraction (PRIMARY for blog domains):**
```bash
node infrastructure/services/etl/bin/fetch-page.js {url}
# Exit 0 = success, 1 = blocked domain (skip), 2-4 = try WebFetch fallback
```

**Supported Blog Domains (ETL primary):**
dev.to, medium.com, marktechpost.com, hashnode.dev, hackernoon.com, freecodecamp.org/news, blog.*, *.blog.*

## Quick Start

```
/tech-research "como implementar rate limiting em Node.js"
```

The skill will:
1. Auto-detect focus (technical) and domain (Node.js) -- skip clarification
2. Decompose into sub-queries (definitions, libraries, examples, benchmarks)
3. Search all sub-queries in parallel
4. Evaluate coverage, iterate if needed
5. Synthesize findings into a structured report
6. Save to `docs/research/2026-02-07-rate-limiting-nodejs/`

---

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```
/tech-research "your technical question here"
```

The skill accepts any technical question in Portuguese or English.

### Auto-Clarification Behavior

The skill analyzes your query before asking questions:

- **Query contains technical keywords** (code, api, implementation, etc.) or **known technologies** (React, PostgreSQL, Docker, etc.): Proceeds directly with 0 questions.
- **Query is ambiguous** (e.g., "pesquise sobre performance"): Asks 1 combined clarification question.
- **auto_clarification section missing from SKILL.md** (backward compat): Falls back to original 3-question flow.

### Tuning Token Budgets

Edit `.claude/skills/tech-research/config.yaml`:

```yaml
tokens:
  decomposition_output: 500    # Max tokens for query decomposition output
  source_content_max: 1000     # Max tokens per individual source (truncates longer)
  synthesis_input_max: 5000    # Max total tokens fed to synthesis phase
  final_report_max: 2000       # Soft limit for final report output
```

- **Lower values** = cheaper, faster, more concise reports
- **Higher values** = more thorough but more expensive
- All budgets use soft limits (prompt instructions) except source_content_max (hard truncation)

### Tuning Iteration Parameters

```yaml
iteration:
  max_iterations: 3            # Hard cap on search waves (1 = single wave, no iteration)
  coverage_threshold: 0.8      # Stop when coverage >= 80% (range: 0.0-1.0)
  min_new_info_ratio: 0.1      # Stop when new info < 10% (diminishing returns)
```

- **max_iterations: 1** = disable iteration loop (single search wave, like v1)
- **coverage_threshold: 0.9** = higher quality bar, more iterations
- **min_new_info_ratio: 0.05** = tolerate more diminishing returns before stopping

### Expected Output Structure

```
docs/research/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/
+-- README.md                    # Index + TL;DR
+-- 00-query-original.md         # Original question + context
+-- 01-deep-research-prompt.md   # Generated research prompt
+-- 02-research-report.md        # Complete findings + Coverage Evaluation Summary
+-- 03-recommendations.md        # Recommendations and next steps
+-- metrics.yaml                 # Mandatory run metrics
+-- pipeline-state.yaml          # Mandatory run state
```

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Skill asks 3 questions instead of 0-1 | `auto_clarification` section missing or malformed | Verify SKILL.md YAML block is valid |
| Single search wave (no iteration) | `prompts/evaluate.md` missing | Restore file from skill directory |
| No query decomposition | `prompts/decompose.md` missing | Restore file from skill directory |
| config.yaml parse error in logs | Invalid YAML syntax | Validate YAML (check indentation, colons) |
| Sources marked [TRUNCATED] | Source exceeded `source_content_max` budget | Normal behavior; increase budget if needed |

---

## Configuration Reference

### config.yaml

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `tokens.decomposition_output` | int | 500 | Max tokens for Phase 1.5 decomposition output |
| `tokens.source_content_max` | int | 1000 | Max tokens per source; hard truncation with [TRUNCATED] marker |
| `tokens.synthesis_input_max` | int | 5000 | Max total tokens fed to Phase 4 synthesis; lowest-priority sources dropped |
| `tokens.final_report_max` | int | 2000 | Soft limit for final report output (via prompt instruction) |
| `iteration.max_iterations` | int | 3 | Hard cap on search waves; FORCE STOP at this count |
| `iteration.coverage_threshold` | float | 0.8 | Stop when coverage_score >= threshold * 100 |
| `iteration.min_new_info_ratio` | float | 0.1 | Stop when new_info_ratio < this value (2nd+ iteration only) |

All values have built-in defaults in SKILL.md. If config.yaml is missing or fails to parse, defaults are used automatically.

## Metrics: v1 vs v2

### v1 Baseline (measured, Story 0.1)

| Query | Type | Tokens | Time | Cost (Sonnet) | Quality |
|-------|------|--------|------|---------------|---------|
| Q1: "o que e RAG?" | Simple | 70,944 | 3m 38s | $0.21 | 4/5 |
| Q2: "rate limiting Node.js" | Technical | 67,012 | 2m 59s | $0.20 | 4/5 |
| Q4: "deep research LLMs" | Deep | 88,543 | 4m 40s | $0.27 | 5/5 |
| **Average** | - | **75,500** | **3m 46s** | **$0.40*** | **4.3/5** |

*Cost recalculated with 80/20 input/output split

### v2 Feature-by-Feature Impact (expected)

| Metric | v1 Baseline | v2 Feature | Expected Impact | Status |
|--------|-------------|------------|-----------------|--------|
| Questions asked | 3 (always) | Auto-clarification | 0-1 questions | Implemented |
| Search approach | Sequential | Parallel dispatch | -50% time | Implemented |
| Cost control | None | Token budgets | Predictable cost | Implemented |
| Search depth | Single wave | Iteration loop | Adaptive depth | Implemented |
| Config | Hardcoded | config.yaml | Tunable | Implemented |
| Average cost | $0.40 | Target: $0.20 | -50% | Needs validation |
| Average time | 3m 46s | Target: 1m 53s | -50% | Needs validation |
| Quality | 4.3/5 | Target: >=3.9/5 | >=90% maintained | Needs validation |

**Note:** Quantitative v2 metrics (cost, time, quality) are projections based on implemented features. Actual measurements require a validation run with the 5 baseline queries.

### What Was Validated vs What Needs Manual Validation

**Validated (implemented and verified):**
- Auto-clarification: pattern matching and technology detection working
- Query decomposition: decompose.md produces 3-7 sub-queries
- Parallel search: WebSearch calls dispatched simultaneously
- Stopping criteria: coverage evaluation loop with configurable thresholds
- Token budgets: config.yaml loaded and enforced across all phases

**Needs manual validation run:**
- Average cost reduction >= 50% (requires executing 5 test queries)
- Average time reduction >= 50% (requires timed execution)
- Quality maintained >= 90% of baseline (requires subjective evaluation)

---

## Backward Compatibility

Every v3 feature has an explicit fallback to v2 behavior:

| Feature | Fallback | Trigger |
|---------|----------|---------|
| ETL for blogs | WebFetch (v2 behavior) | ETL service unavailable or fetch-page.js fails with exit code 2-4 |
| Optional worker routing | Main model execution | Runtime does not expose a real `deep-researcher` worker |
| Subagent parallelism | Sequential execution | Task tool dispatch fails for any subagent |
| ETL for YouTube | No fallback (ETL has 100% success rate) | Should not fail |

## Changelog

### v3.2 (2026-05-06) - Runtime-Honest Mechanical Traceability

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Runtime-honest Phase 3 | Main-context Agent is the default. `deep-researcher` is optional only when actually available. |
| Mandatory metrics/state | `metrics.yaml` and `pipeline-state.yaml` are required before completion. |
| Blocking validator | `output_validator.py` fails on missing metrics, pipeline state, workflow_version, citation marker, or scope declaration when required. |
| workflow_version | Added version marker to SKILL metadata and output metadata contract. |
| Partial-read gate | Self-trigger gate stops execution before partial operational reads. |
| Internal refs validator | `validate:skill-internal-refs` verifies tech-research local file references. |

### v3.1 (2026-02-08) - Wave Memory Compression

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Phase 3.6: Wave Compression | New phase compresses wave results via Haiku into ~400 token summaries saved to wave-N-summary.md. Reduces context accumulation by ~92% across waves. |
| Phase 3 step 4: Load wave context | Wave 2+ reads previous wave summaries instead of carrying raw results. Focuses new queries on gaps from last summary. |
| Phase 4: Reads summaries | Synthesis now reads wave-*-summary.md files instead of raw results. Falls back to raw results if no summaries exist (backward compat). |
| Flow diagram updated | Shows Phase 3.6 compress step and summary file flow between waves and synthesis. |
| Executor matrix updated | Wave Compression registered as AGENT (HAIKU) operation. |

Architecture doc: `docs/research/2026-02-08-open-source-deep-research-multi-agent/04-wave-memory-compression.md`

### v3.0 (2026-02-08) - Story 3.1: Execution Optimization
